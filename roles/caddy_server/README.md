# maxhoesel.caddy.caddy_server

Install and initialize a Caddy server.

This role installs the stable version of `caddy` from the official [repositories](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install) and performs basic configuration.
The role will configure the server so that it can be managed with the modules in this collection.
Alternatively, you can also configure caddy with a Caddyfile by passing it to this role.

## Requirements

- The following distributions are currently supported:
  - Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or newer
  - Debian 10 or newer
  - A CentOS 8-compatible distribution like RockyLinux or AlmaLinux. RockyLinux is used for testing
  - ArchLinux (tested against the latest package versions)
- Supported architectures: Anything supported by upstream caddy should work
- This role requires root access. Make sure to run this role with `become: yes` or equivalent
